# Welcome to My To DO app

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems.

```
$ bundle install --without production
```
Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```
Lastly, run a test:

```
$ rails test
```

Now you can run the app in a local server

```
$ rails server
```
